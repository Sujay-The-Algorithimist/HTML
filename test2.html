    <h1>The crow and the peebles</h1> <br>
    <p>Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a clever crow named Kavi. Kavi was known for his intelligence and problem-solving skills. One hot summer day, he was flying over a parched field when he spotted a pitcher half-buried in the ground. <br>

        Kavi was thirsty, but the water level in the pitcher was too low for him to reach. He tried dipping his beak, but it was futile. The crow sat there, pondering how to quench his thirst. <br>
        
        Then, an idea struck him. He noticed a pile of pebbles nearby. Kavi picked up one pebble at a time and dropped it into the pitcher. With each pebble, the water level rose slightly. Kavi continued this process until the water was high enough for him to drink. <br>
        
        The villagers watched in amazement as the crow solved the problem. Kavi had turned a seemingly impossible situation into an opportunity. His determination and cleverness had saved the day. <br>
        
        And so, the crow and the pebbles became a legend in the village. Whenever someone faced a challenge, they would say, “Be like Kavi—use your wits and turn adversity into advantage.”</p> <br> <hr>
